## Task 1: Software configuration.
## Subtask1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
**Being that the modern world does not stand still and the world of computer technology is developing rapidly, 
and that is why I decided to try myself in something new. 
I want to feel these changes is not from the Google page.
From the project I expect new knowledge and opportunities.
Thank you very much for participating in your project:)**
